Kairos-based Intrusion Detection System (KIDS) is a powerful and flexible protection system which is powered by an Intrusion Detection GNN model named [Kairos](https://github.com/ProvenanceAnalytics/kairos/tree/main).

## Introduction

In response to many existing security challenges and business scenarios, we have implemented the Kairos Based Intrusion Detection System (KIDS), which can collect, report and analyze network security threat intrusion data, and use the most advanced graph neural network to analyze the collected data and trace the attack source to help users accurately identify and trace the source and behavior of network security threats
